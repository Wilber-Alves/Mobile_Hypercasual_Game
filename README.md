### Core Systems & Item Mechanics Update

In this update, I focused on structuring the game's technical foundation by creating the EDGEE - CORE folder, where I implemented the Singleton pattern for global management. The item system was redesigned using Scriptable Objects for coins and configurable data, in addition to implementing an Item Manager and basic scripts for collection. On the visual and movement side, I added animations for coins, a Lerp Helper system to smooth player actions, and dedicated logic for detecting item collection.

Scripts were created for player movement and coin collection was tested along a simple path. Implementation of player movement and coin collection system. Level 1 was updated with new materials, obstacles, and the creation of prefabs for optimization. Additionally, I performed an organizational restructuring of the project, including the creation of configuration folders, relocation of scripts, and updating of .meta files.
